## Documentation

```
var perceive = require('perceive');
```

#### perceive(value, options)

The `value` is what will be formated and can be anything that `JSON.stringify`
can serialize and a few more things, such as:

* undefined
* Date
* Regexp
* Function

The `options` object only support a single option `colors`. If this is `true`
(default is `false`) the output will be [ANSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)
colorized for a terminal makeing it even more readable.

The actual output is technically YAML, this output format was chosen because:

* It is much more readable than JSON, e.q. multiline strings particularly.
* By outputting an actual language you will should be in doubt about what the
output means on a data level. If you are its a bug, so please report it.
